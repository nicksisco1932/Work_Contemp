## 3. Pattern of Mistreatment Toward Staff & Vendors

**Ongoing Issues:**  
DOCTOR has engaged in repeated instances of unprofessional behavior, including:

- **Disrespectful Treatment:** Condescending and dismissive interactions with staff.  
- **Blame-Shifting:** Holding staff responsible for his own disorganization and miscommunication.

- **False Accusations:**  
  - Accused Nicholas J. Sisco, Ph.D., of violating HIPAA by viewing medical records DOCTOR himself provided.  
  - Falsely alleged software/system malfunctions.  
  - Blamed Sisco for cooling bag mismanagement caused by his own MRI tech.  
  - On March 13, 2025, emailed managers about Sisco rather than discussing matters face-to-face; claimed that Sisco asking questions undermines his leadership.

- Unable to grasp core concepts such as U-Net segmentation algorithms, yet asserts authority in areas he doesn't understand.

**Impact:**

## Recommendations & Next Steps

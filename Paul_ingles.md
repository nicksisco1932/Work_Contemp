Professional Conduct Documentation

Compiled by: Dr. Nicholas J. Sisco
Position: Clinical Scientist
Scope: Documentation of hostile behavior, gaslighting, and misconduct involving Paul ⟪Last Name, redacted for privacy⟫


---

📌 Incident #1 – Profane Language and Verbal Abuse

Date: Fall 2024
Context:
During a call regarding a clinical science eligibility report, Paul stated:

> "What a piece of shit report this is. It’s the biggest piece of shit report I’ve ever seen."



Commentary:
This language was unprovoked and inappropriate. The report was technically sound and aligned with clinical scope, but Paul was frustrated that it did not contain declarative language on eligibility—an area that had already been ruled outside the clinical scientist’s role.


---

📌 Incident #2 – Inappropriate Behavior in MR Room

Date: Spring 2025
Context:
Paul made homophobic and offensive jokes in the MR room in front of multiple staff members:

2 nurses

1 anesthesiologist

1 urologist

1 radiologist

3 MR technologists


Impact:
This created a hostile and uncomfortable clinical environment for all those present.


---

📌 Incident #3 – Repeated Gaslighting and Role Misassignment

Date: Ongoing (2024–2025)
Context:
Paul has repeatedly pressured members of the clinical team to assume inventory responsibilities that fall under site operations. Despite clear definitions of scope, he continues to misrepresent these duties as shared or ambiguous.

Tactics Used:

Emotional manipulation

Implying team members are not "supportive" if they don't comply

Misstating historical precedent in order to shift responsibility

📌 Incident #4 – Hostile and Manipulative Email (May 20, 2025)

Quote:

> "You’d care if you were paying the bills, Nick."



Commentary:
This personal remark was delivered in response to a clear, professional boundary-setting message. It attempts to undermine Dr. Sisco’s authority by suggesting he lacks financial accountability—despite his oversight of multimillion-dollar NIH-funded research projects.


---

📌 Incident #5 – Technology-Related Tantrums During Reviews

Date: Ongoing
Context:
During eligibility reviews, Paul regularly directs profane language at software or equipment. Phrases like “piece of shit” are commonplace.

Impact:
These outbursts occur frequently enough to affect team focus and contribute to a volatile working environment.


---

📌 Incident #6 – On-Site Confrontation and Role Circumvention

Date: June 7, 2025
Context:
While on-site, Paul demanded tool tracking updates and again failed to use appropriate clinical nomenclature. He attempted to bypass proper communication channels and pressured Dr. Sisco to send him information directly.

Response:
Dr. Sisco calmly reiterated that all updates and reimbursement matters must go through the correct personnel (e.g., Darhika) and that Paul’s own techs are responsible for their records. Dr. Sisco clarified that internal tracking is maintained for the clinical team but external accountability must be managed by site operations.

Behavioral Notes:
Paul became visibly angry and raised his voice, saying:

> "Send the info I need."
He emphasized tool reimbursement and resisted redirection to protocol.



Pattern Link:
This fits an escalating pattern of on-site boundary pushing and attempts to assert dominance outside of professional process.

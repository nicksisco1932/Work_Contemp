# Professional Conduct Documentation  
**Compiled by:** Dr. Nicholas J. Sisco  
**Position:** Clinical Scientist  
**Scope:** Documentation of hostile behavior, gaslighting, and misconduct involving Paul Last Name, redacted for privacy

## 📌 Incident #1 – Profane Language and Verbal Abuse  
**Date:** Fall 2024  
**Context:**  
During a call regarding a clinical science eligibility report, Paul stated:

> "What a piece of shit report this is. It’s the biggest piece of shit report I’ve ever seen."

**Commentary:**  
This language was unprovoked and inappropriate. The report was technically sound and aligned with clinical scope, but Paul was frustrated that it did not contain declarative language on eligibility—an area that had already been ruled outside the clinical scientist’s role.

## 📌 Incident #2 – Inappropriate Behavior in MR Room  
**Date:** Spring 2025  
**Context:**  
Paul made homophobic and offensive jokes in the MR room in front of multiple staff members:  
- 2 nurses  
- 1 anesthesiologist  
- 1 urologist  
- 1 radiologist  
- 3 MR technologists  

**Impact:**  
This created a hostile and uncomfortable clinical environment for all those present.

## 📌 Incident #3 – Repeated Gaslighting and Role Misassignment  
**Date:** Ongoing (2024–2025)  
**Context:**  
Paul has repeatedly pressured members of the clinical team to assume inventory responsibilities that fall under site operations. Despite clear definitions of scope, he continues to misrepresent these duties as shared or ambiguous.

**Tactics Used:**  
- Emotional manipulation  
- Implying team members are not "supportive" if they don't comply  
- Misstating historical precedent in order to shift responsibility

## 📌 Incident #4 – Hostile and Manipulative Email (May 20, 2025)  
**Quote:**  
> "You’d care if you were paying the bills, Nick."

**Commentary:**  
This personal remark was delivered in response to a clear, professional boundary-setting message. It attempts to undermine Dr. Sisco’s authority by suggesting he lacks financial accountability—despite his oversight of multimillion-dollar NIH-funded research projects.

## 📌 Incident #5 – Technology-Related Tantrums During Reviews  
**Date:** Ongoing  
**Context:**  
During eligibility reviews, Paul regularly directs profane language at software or equipment. Phrases like “piece of shit” are commonplace.

**Impact:**  
These outbursts occur frequently enough to affect team focus and contribute to a volatile working environment.

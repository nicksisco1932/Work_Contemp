  <h1>Professional Conduct Documentation</h1>
  <p><strong>Compiled by:</strong> Dr. Nicholas J. Sisco<br/>
     <strong>Position:</strong> Clinical Scientist<br/>
     <strong>Scope:</strong> Documentation of hostile behavior, gaslighting, and misconduct involving Paul [Last Name, if included internally]</p>

  <div class="incident">
    <h3>Incident #1 – Profane Language and Verbal Abuse</h3>
    <p><span class="tag">Date:</span> Fall 2024</p>
    <p><span class="tag">Context:</span> During a call regarding a clinical science eligibility report, Paul stated, <code>"What a piece of shit report this is. It’s the biggest piece of shit report I’ve ever seen."</code></p>
    <p><span class="tag">Commentary:</span> This language was unprovoked and inappropriate. The report was technically sound and aligned with clinical scope, but Paul was frustrated that it did not contain declarative language on eligibility, which had already been ruled outside the clinical scientist’s role.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <h3>Incident #2 – Inappropriate Behavior in MR Room</h3>
    <p><span class="tag">Date:</span> Spring 2025</p>
    <p><span class="tag">Context:</span> Paul made homophobic jokes in the MR room in front of multiple witnesses (2 nurses, 1 anesthesiologist, 1 urologist, 1 radiologist, 3 MR techs). This created a hostile environment and reflected a serious lapse in professional decorum.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <h3>Incident #3 – Repeated Gaslighting and Role Misassignment</h3>
    <p><span class="tag">Date:</span> Ongoing (2024–2025)</p>
    <p><span class="tag">Context:</span> Paul routinely attempted to shift responsibility for tool inventory tracking onto the clinical team, despite repeated clarifications that this falls under site-level operations. He often used emotionally manipulative language to pressure others into compliance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <h3>Incident #4 – Hostile and Manipulative Email (May 20, 2025)</h3>
    <p><span class="tag">Quote:</span> <code>"You'd care if you were paying the bills, Nick."</code></p>
    <p><span class="tag">Commentary:</span> This ad hominem remark misrepresents Dr. Sisco’s background (including prior NIH grant oversight) and attempts to discredit him based on an unfounded personal assertion. It was delivered in response to a clear and professional boundary-setting email.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <h3>Incident #5 – Technology-Related Tantrums During Reviews</h3>
    <p><span class="tag">Date:</span> Ongoing</p>
    <p><span class="tag">Context:</span> During eligibility reviews, Paul frequently uses profane language directed at technology or tools. These outbursts disrupt the working environment and contribute to a pattern of emotionally volatile behavior.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="incident">
    <h3>Incident #6 – On-Site Confrontation and Power Assertion</h3>
    <p><span class="tag">Date:</span> June 7, 2025</p>
    <p><span class="tag">Context:</span> While on-site, Paul attempted to assert authority by directly requesting updates on tool usage. He did not use correct nomenclature and tried to circumvent formal communication protocols. Dr. Sisco calmly redirected him to the proper channels (Darhika and Paul’s own techs), noting that he maintains internal tracking but that Paul is responsible for his own operational accounting.</p>
    <p><span class="tag">Behavioral Notes:</span> Paul became visibly angry and raised his voice, saying <code>"Send the info I need."</code> and emphasized that reimbursements were owed. Despite agreeing in principle, Dr. Sisco reiterated that such matters must go through the proper reimbursement pathways. The interaction was tense and attempted to bypass established professional boundaries.</p>
    <p><span class="tag">Pattern Commentary:</span> This continues a recurring pattern of confrontation, disregard for roles, and attempts to pressure or override formal processes.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This documentation reflects factual, dated incidents based on direct observation, emails, and witnessed events. It is intended for internal reference or formal escalation as needed.</p>

# üìò Clinical Scientist Scope ‚Äì Profound Medical (TULSA)

## ‚úÖ What Profound Provides (Defined Scope)

- ‚úÖ **MRI Suitability Review**  
  We assess pre-treatment MRI to determine if anatomy is appropriate for TULSA.

- ‚úÖ **Procedure Planning Support**  
  We assist with contouring and treatment feasibility‚Äîbased solely on MRI.

- ‚úÖ **Device Safety and Workflow Feedback**  
  Post-case reviews focus on procedural performance, not diagnostic interpretation.

- ‚úÖ **Radiologist Collaboration**  
  We assume radiologists perform the formal reads of MRI, CT, or PET-CT as needed.

## ‚ùå Requests That Exceed Our Scope

- ‚ùå **CT Interpretation**  
  We are not licensed radiologists. Reviewing CTs for calcifications‚Äîespecially after a board-certified radiologist already cleared them‚Äîis redundant and outside our role.

- ‚ùå **Post-TURP Imaging Oversight**  
  Following up after surgical intervention is clinical care coordination, not technical device support.

- ‚ùå **Multi-Stage Image Clearance**  
  Expecting Profound to review MRI, then CT, and then follow-up imaging constitutes serial diagnostic responsibility, which falls squarely outside our deliverables.

- ‚ùå **Assuming Liability for Radiologist Judgments**  
  If a radiologist states ‚Äúno calcifications,‚Äù we defer to that conclusion. Profound does not override radiologic findings or insert secondary opinions.

## üî¨ Comparison: Clinical Scientist Roles Across Disciplines

## üö® Where the TULSA Role Is Already Expanded

- **Intraoperative Involvement**  
  Hands-on, high-stakes support during procedures‚Äîfar beyond most device reps.

- **Real-Time MRI Guidance**  
  We‚Äôre more embedded in the imaging workflow than typical device specialists, though still not radiologists.

- **Strategic Scientific Contribution**  
  Contributions to AI, clinical trial design, and RF modeling extend well beyond traditional clinical scientist expectations.

## ‚ùå Why CT Review / TURP Follow-Up Is a Red Flag

- **Exceeds Standard Practice**  
  No clinical scientist in any medical device discipline is expected to re-review imaging already read by a credentialed radiologist.

- **Blurs Liability Lines**  
  Reviewing CTs assumes risk for diagnostic interpretation‚Äîa task you are not credentialed to perform.

- **Adds Unsustainable Workload**  
  Serial review workflows (MRI ‚Üí CT ‚Üí post-TURP) are not standard in device support. Doing so would require formal consultation agreements or expanded staffing.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Final Note:** The TULSA Clinical Scientist role is already among the most comprehensive and demanding in the industry. Stretching it into serial diagnostic review and clinical coordination crosses a professional and ethical boundary‚Äîand risks both safety and operational sustainability.

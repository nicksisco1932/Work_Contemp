# 🔐 Security Policy for Internal Behavioral Documentation Repository

This repository is maintained privately by Dr. Nicholas J. Sisco, Ph.D., for the exclusive purpose of recording internal communication patterns, boundary-pushing behaviors, and potential compliance risks related to clinical and operational functions.

## ⚠️ Confidential Use Only
- This repository is **strictly private**.
- It is not to be shared, distributed, or made public under any circumstances.
- It contains **no raw PHI** or directly identifying patient data, in compliance with HIPAA and internal governance policies.

## 🔐 Security Measures
- The repository is secured by:
  - GitHub 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)
  - A strong, high-entropy password unique to this account
  - Private repository settings
  - Local encryption of all exported email metadata and logs

## 🛡️ Purpose
- To ensure professional protection in high-risk interdepartmental interactions
- To maintain an audit trail of any pattern of noncompliance or unapproved data access requests
- To support defensible action if legal or HR review becomes necessary

## 🧾 Audit Contents (No PHI)
- Metadata from emails (sender, date, subject, attachment status)
- Markdown summaries of behavior, communication tone, and risk profile
- Timelines of escalation or pressure to circumvent protocol

## 🚫 Do Not
- Store, copy, or reference full emails containing PHI
- Upload attachments or screenshots containing clinical data
- Grant repo access to anyone without explicit legal or compliance approval

## ✅ Best Practices
- Continue documenting only metadata and behavioral patterns
- Use Markdown formatting to keep records clear and structured
- Time-stamp and version-control all entries for full traceability

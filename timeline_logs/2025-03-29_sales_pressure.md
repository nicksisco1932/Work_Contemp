# Internal Behavioral Profiles & Documentation Repository

This repository is maintained privately by Dr. Nicholas J. Sisco, Ph.D., for the purpose of documenting internal behavior, communication patterns, and compliance-relevant risks within the organization. It is intended to:

- Track escalating or boundary-pushing behavior across functional teams
- Document email communications or informal pressure that may result in professional or legal exposure
- Provide an audit trail for incidents involving clinical governance, HIPAA sensitivity, or interdepartmental overreach

All entries are timestamped, factual, and intended to preserve professional integrity in high-risk organizational climates.

# Kat Godinho
**Role:** Clinical Sales Specialist  
**First Noted Interaction:** March 2025

## Behavior Summary
- Asserted that HIPAA restrictions do not apply to case reports, despite identifiable context (rare procedure, known patient location, date of service).
- Framed her own interpretation as consensus ("we’re all aligned") despite disagreement from clinical science side.
- Coordinated with Adam to apply social pressure to change distribution protocols without routing through management.
- Did not involve or defer to Amanda or Rob, despite not having decision authority.

## Communication Samples
- March 29 Email: Claimed reports lack PHI and should be shared with entire account team.
- March 30 Follow-up: Invoked tone of consensus and deferred to Adam to reinforce position.

## Risk Profile
- High likelihood of continuing to push for access to clinical data outside her role.
- Uses persuasive, alignment-based language to override procedural boundaries.
- Shows disregard for HIPAA’s contextual re-identifiability standards.
- Unlikely to accept deferment to clinical leadership without external reinforcement.

# Sue Owens
**Role:** Sales Team Member (Regional)  
**First Noted Interaction:** February–March 2025

## Behavior Summary
- Frequently requests access to clinical treatment reports.
- Frames requests as casual or relational (e.g., “can you CC me?”) instead of going through formal process.
- Attempts to reframe intent post hoc when access is denied (“original intent… is being misconstrued”).
- Uses direct messaging channels to bypass team-level communication.
- Responds positively to reinforcement of boundaries but only after redirection.

## Communication Tone
- Casual, friendly, at times overly informal.
- Mixes clinical requests with social conversation.
- Attempts to build rapport in parallel with access attempts.

## Risk Profile
- Moderate.  
  Not overtly adversarial, but patterns indicate a tendency to blur professional boundaries in service of goals. Could unintentionally overstep roles without realizing the regulatory consequences. Requires clear, documented boundaries.

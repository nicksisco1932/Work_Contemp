# Internal Behavioral Profiles & Documentation Repository

This repository is maintained privately by Dr. Nicholas J. Sisco, Ph.D., for the purpose of documenting internal behavior, communication patterns, and compliance-relevant risks within the organization. It is intended to:

- Track escalating or boundary-pushing behavior across functional teams
- Document email communications or informal pressure that may result in professional or legal exposure
- Provide an audit trail for incidents involving clinical governance, HIPAA sensitivity, or interdepartmental overreach

All entries are timestamped, factual, and intended to preserve professional integrity in high-risk organizational climates.

# Kat Godinho
**Role:** Clinical Sales Specialist  
**First Noted Interaction:** March 2025

## Behavior Summary
- Asserted that HIPAA restrictions do not apply to case reports, despite identifiable context (rare procedure, known patient location, date of service).
- Framed her own interpretation as consensus ("we’re all aligned") despite disagreement from clinical science side.
- Coordinated with Adam to apply social pressure to change distribution protocols without routing through management.
- Did not involve or defer to Amanda or Rob, despite not having decision authority.

## Communication Samples
- March 29 Email: Claimed reports lack PHI and should be shared with entire account team.
- March 30 Follow-up: Invoked tone of consensus and deferred to Adam to reinforce position.

## Risk Profile
- High likelihood of continuing to push for access to clinical data outside her role.
- Uses persuasive, alignment-based language to override procedural boundaries.
- Shows disregard for HIPAA’s contextual re-identifiability standards.
- Unlikely to accept deferment to clinical leadership without external reinforcement.
